# CPP-graphical-Tic-Tac-Toe
C++ graphical Tic Tac Toe game using C-Turtle. See here for the voice controlled version https://github.com/markhliu/Cplusplus-Voice-Tic-Tac-Toe.

## About this repo
This repo is to create a fun graphical Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The graphics are created using the CTurtle library, borrowed heavily from Jesse Walker's repo [here](https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle). To play the game, enter a number between 1 and 9 at the prompt and press ENTER. This repo is to prepare for a final repo on voice controlled graphical Tic Tac Toe game in C++. 

## How to play the game
Put the file helloworld.cpp, along with the files CImg.h and CTurtle.hpp (both downloaded from Jesse Walker's repo) in the same folder and compile it.
